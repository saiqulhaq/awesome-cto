# Good software documentation

A good software documentation should has an **introduction** phase, which is very useful for newcomer
It should be **searchable** too, but the most important part is it has API documentation  
The good example is https://serverjs.io/documentation
We can generate the same doc using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [demo](https://docusaurus.io/docs/playground)
