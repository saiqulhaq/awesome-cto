# What is a CTO?
It is the leader of the technology organization, who leverage technology to help the company beat the competition.
In a tech company, the CTO should be the one person on the executive team who looks at those two factors and says, “Yes, that’s my job.” You don’t have to identify the business need — that can come from the CEO, marketing, or sales— but you have to understand it well enough to deliver the right leverage. If you really want to fulfill your role, you can’t just say, “tell me what to build.”

How to be a successful CTO? 
A good CTO has to have a balanced view of people, product, and technology. Overweighting technical experience eventually becomes a handicap.

# Good software documentation

A good software documentation should has an **introduction** phase, which is very useful for newcomer
It should be **searchable** too, but the most important part is it has API documentation  
The good example is https://serverjs.io/documentation
We can generate the same doc using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [demo](https://docusaurus.io/docs/playground)
